# Backlog

Captured ideas not yet scheduled into a sprint.

## Enhancements

- **`xp` per-gameweek breakdown** — show xP for each gameweek in the horizon, not just
  the total (e.g. a small `GW1 GW2 GW3 …` mini-row per player). From Tony's Sprint 006
  reflection. Note: FPL only publishes `ep_next` (next GW), so there is no FPL
  multi-week total to show alongside.
- **Bench order** — which bench player subs on first (Sprint 012 sequel).
- **Saved / persistent squad** — store the user's own squad (user state) separately from
  FPL reference data; reload + re-price after a refresh. A new persistence concept.

### Done (kept for the trail)

- ~~Include / exclude players~~ — **DONE** (Sprint 008, ADR-009).
- ~~`xp`/`squad` objective toggle~~ — **DONE** (Sprint 010, ADR-011).
- ~~Full 15-man squad~~ — **DONE** (Sprint 011, `squad --full`, ADR-012).
- ~~Declared bench~~ — **DONE** (Sprint 012, `squad --bench`, ADR-013).
- ~~Flexible formations~~ — **DONE** (Sprint 013, `squad --formation` + flexible default,
  ADR-014). Ranges (DEF 3–5, MID 2–5, FWD 1–3); the bench-implied shape shown in `--full`.
- ~~Validate a declared bench yields a legal XI~~ — **DONE** (Sprint 021, `legal_xi_issues`,
  ADR-022). Warns (not blocks) when a full 4-man bench leaves an illegal XI; reuses `XI_FLEX`.

## Validated, deferred

- **soccerdata / npXG** — evaluated in Sprint 015 ([ADR-016](06_Decisions/ADR-016-soccerdata-evaluation.md)).
  Matching works (~95% FPL↔Understat) and npXG is real, **but** the value is narrow
  (penalties score points in FPL, so penalty-inclusive xG is the relevant signal) and the
  cost is high (14 → 72 packages incl. a selenium/pandas stack, scraping fragility, a
  season-alignment trap). **Deferred.** Revisit only if a decision-driving need appears
  that FPL can't meet — and prefer a *lightweight* direct Understat fetch over the full
  library. Evidence: `spikes/015-soccerdata/`.

## Tech debt

- **Migrate to the PuLP 4.0 API** — use `prob.add_variable(...)` / `COIN_CMD` instead of
  `LpVariable(...)` / `PULP_CBC_CMD` (currently the 4.0 deprecation notices are
  scope-suppressed in `src/analytics/optimizer.py`).

## Deferred (data-dependent — need season-start data)

- Richer xP: recent `form` + expected minutes.
- Attack/Defence FDR split (needs `strength_attack_*` / `strength_defence_*`).
